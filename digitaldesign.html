					<br>
					<p>
						When I joined STITCH, I loved scrolling through the website and seeing the graphics bring the story to life.
						As part of design staff, I took 1-2 assignments weekly and produced graphics or GIFs as needed. Since I enjoyed creating
						these graphics so much, I applied to be one of the Design Editors (mainly to focus on the digital side of design).

					<br>
					<p>
						Every quarter, the Knight Lab pulls together multidisciplinary teams of students together to collaborate
						on projects that they believe is important for the future of media. I had the fortunate experience of being chosen
						to be part of the 5-member team to work on the project "Augmented Reality Features with 3D Food Photography." Throughout the quarter,
						we experimented with AR and VR and how it can be implemented to showcase various food products. My team and I worked to
						create an immersive experience built with the help of Blender that we uploaded on Torch, but the application has since then
						been discontinued. With our extra time, we also created a more simplified AR experience with the help of
						Facebook's SparkAR by creating a filter that we hoped would connect the Northwestern student body.

						<p>
							In Professor Susan Mango Curtis's JOUR 376: Media Design, we worked on designing an alternative story form, magazine cover and spread,
							and interactive mobile app prototype built on Adobe XD. The following prototype was based off a magazine I previously had written, and all graphics were created on Illustrator.
