                <br>
                <p>
                    This quarter, I took UX Design with Professor Pam Daniels out in San Francisco. The course was fast-paced
                    with many design sprints and exercises:
                        <ul class="dd_ul">
                            <li class="dd_li"><a href="images/supersimpleapp.pdf">Creating a super simple application that was graded by our peers!</a></li>

                        </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The beauty of the Bay Area Immersion Program was the fact we were working in a studio
                    environment in a multidisciplinary team. At the start of the quarter, our groups were tasked
                    with creating prototypes and iterating after user feedback for medical accesibility. Then, we
                    chose our final project's topic of focus: making parking more efficient in large cities. While
                    the project is ongoing, you can check out our current progress <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P_LRLRwrCULI78hrMdcXVwEEQBBOJsXQiCq9lQrZpoA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

                <p>
                    I also took this course, taught by Hilary Fung, during my quarter in San Francisco! We were also 
                    grouped together in this team and decided on a story idea ourselves. One of my teammates was a 
                    thrifting enthusiast, so we went in the direction of focusing on the evolution of thrifting culture 
                    in the Bay Area, specifically with the increase of prices due to the recent trendiness of thrifting.
                    We dove into the sourcing, interviewing and research before we began writing, creating 
                    interactives and coding the entire story. This project is also on-going, but check out our draft <a href="https://aggyjlee.github.io/thrifties/index.html">here</a>!

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In this course, I learned a variety of techniques often used in Human-Computer Interaction.
                        For example, I performed a <a href="images/contextualinquiry.pdf">contextual inquiry</a>, which combines interviewing the user about 
                        a procedure while also observing their surroundings. Through open-ended questions and 
                        observations, I determined the pain points of my roommate's photo-editing process and then
                        brainstormed potential areas of improvement for Lightroom. Another major concept that this course 
                        went over was conducting a <a href="images/he.pdf">heuristic evaluation</a>. Based on Nielsen’s list of 10 heuristics, 
                        rules of thumb for user interface design, I analyzed the Fandango website interface for errors 
                        within these heuristics and determined the severity of the issues. In addition, based on these criteria, 
                        I also determined possible fixes such as utilizing a pop-up effect or adding small thumbnails 
                        to remind the consumer of what the website focuses on. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>Building off these research techniques, I worked on a group project for which our goal was to create a prototype for a new streaming 
                        service that would allow users to find personalized, real-time recommendations and connect with 
                        friends with commentary about their viewing history, connecting characteristics of a traditional 
                        streaming application with a social media application. Through user interviews and testing with initial 
                        sketches, we were able to build a working prototype on Figma that used the various heuristics we went over 
                        in class and also addressed our users’ concerns.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After taking a few introductory courses in Computer Science, I wanted to take a course that design-focused 
                            on digital storytelling and interactive news. Here are a few stories I built out that quarter:
                            <ul class="dd_ul">
                                <li class="dd_li"><a href="https://codepen.io/agnesjlee410/pen/dyVYwPN">Scrollytelling assignment based on a NBN feature story</a></li>
                                <li class="dd_li"><a href="https://codepen.io/agnesjlee410/pen/yLzLzEQ">Interactive application based on a magazine story I wrote for another course</a></li>
                            </ul>
                            The course gave me more confidence in my skills and really encouraged me to learn more about creating interactive 
                            stories. Fortunately, I will have the opportunity to dive deep into just that through my Journalism Residency
                            at the San Francisco Chronicle starting this March!

                        <p>
                            Every quarter, the Knight Lab pulls together multidisciplinary teams of students together to collaborate
                            on projects that they believe is important for the future of media. I had the fortunate experience of being chosen
                            to be part of the 5-member team to work on the project "Augmented Reality Features with 3D Food Photography." Throughout the quarter,
                            we experimented with AR and VR and how it can be implemented to showcase various food products. My team and I worked to
                            create an immersive experience built with the help of Blender that we uploaded on Torch, but the application has since then
                            been discontinued. With our extra time, we also created a more simplified AR experience with the help of
                            Facebook's SparkAR by creating a filter that we hoped would connect the Northwestern student body.

                                In Professor Susan Mango Curtis's JOUR 376: Media Design, we worked on designing an alternative story form, magazine cover and spread,
