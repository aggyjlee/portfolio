					<p>I've been very lucky to be able to work at amazing companies like PBS and Glantz Design!
						Both teams taught me a lot throughout my time with them and were willing to develop my interests

						<h3 class="first_proj_hl">PBS Digital Studios</h3>
						<br>
						<p>
							At PBS Digital Studios, I was tasked with managing the social media accounts, mainly
							Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter, creating content, writing social copy, watching first
							video cuts, and updating playlists weekly to showcase new content.

						<p>
							One major assignment that I worked on was a project that I proposed to hopefully
							fill in a gap in the PBSDS Instagram. Since PBS Digital Studios has a younger audience
							than PBS itself, I thought it would be helpful to experiment with the Instagram story
							function. I noticed that many of the Instagram stories that had previously been published
							were reposts of other accounts. Just as many media organization currently do, I thought we
							could both promote various video series and grow the Instagram account by developing interactive
							Instagram stories based on a previously published video. Over a span of two weeks,
							I storyboarded, edited and designed a 15-part Instagram series from the original 20-minute video.

					<!-- Glantz Design -->
					<h3 class= "second_proj_hl">Glantz Design</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						In collaboration with Northwestern's Chicago Field Studies program, I interned at Glantz Design as
						a project management intern for my spring quarter. At first, I wasn't too familiar with project management,
						but from the start, I knew I wanted to work at Glantz due to the amazing work they produced and the positive 
						culture that seemed surround it.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Throughout my ten weeks at Glantz, I worked closely with a project manager and learned first-hand the
						value of communication during business meetings and for client- and designer-specific goals. As a strategic
						designy agency, I learned how to take a client's needs and turn them into actionable objectives that both
						the designer and web developer could create for. This meant meeting with the clients directly and writing out
						creative briefs that became the starting point for the designers.
					</p>

					<p>
						Furthermore, the designers and developers at Glantz allowed me to participate in the design and development
						brainstorming sessions, such as helping with critiquing the sitemap and wireframes. I assisted with optimizing
						image searches and writing better site copy to improve SEO, and I worked on website backends on Wordpress. Overall,
						it wa such a great learning experience for someone interested in working in the creative industry. Check out my
						blog post <a href = "https://glantz.net/blog/10-design-blogs-that-keep-creativity-flowing/">here</a>!
